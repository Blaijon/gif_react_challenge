Thank You for the challenge.

1. To Run locally use npm install, then npm start.

2. Also I left my api key hard coded for instant use only of the app. Since UI was not graded.

3. I didnt focus heavily on it. To get a taste of my UI please visist my profolio in my resume.


App Improvement
- What can this app improve on is breaking more things into stateless components.
- Also some doing things in less steps.
-Using more of redux
